#1. Linearity: The relationship between X and Y must be linear as seen from the graph plotted above

#3. Normality of residuals: The observations should be near the line of the normal probability plot

# Since the Adjusted R-Square value for the MLR model did not increase significantly when more variables were added to create a MLR, it means the SLR model to predict residential energy consumption cannot be improved upon, and it is the best model for this scenario/observations.
# We can also see from the summary(model_2), the P values of he intercept and one person household have *** which shows these are the only important variable to predict the Model. Couples without children do not have the *** which shows it is not an important factor when predicting household energy consumption using the linear model.
