Enakhe Ewanlen_R  - This project shows that among ten countries that are grouped into two continents, residential energy consumption is associated with the number of household members living in the residential apartment. To achieve this aim, the following tasks were decided:
• Define the factors affecting residential energy consumption in ten countries for ten years.
• Analyze and identify which factor(s) significantly impact residential energy consumption.
• To compare residential energy consumption recorded for ten different countries.
• To compare residential energy consumption recorded for two different continents.
The methods applied in carrying out the analysis in this coursework include correlation analysis, regression analysis, and time series analysis.
The analysis is based on sample data from five European countries such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and five North American countries, such as
For ten years, Canada, Cuba, the United States of America, Mexico, and Jamaica (2010 to 2019).
